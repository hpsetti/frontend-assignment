# Getting Started

In order for this web app to run, we need to install certain node modules (that I've installed during development). 
For that, type in your command line : `npm install`.


## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
